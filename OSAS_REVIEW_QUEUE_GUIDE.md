# üéØ OSAS Review Queue - Complete Guide

## ‚úÖ What I Fixed

### 1. **Access to "All Applications"**
**Problem:** OSAS staff couldn't access the "All Applications" page  
**Solution:** Updated `view_applications` view to allow both Admin and OSAS access

**Changes Made:**
```python
# Before: Only admins
if not request.user.profile.is_admin:
    messages.error(request, 'Access denied.')
    
# After: Admins and OSAS
if not (request.user.profile.is_admin or request.user.profile.is_osas):
    messages.error(request, 'Access denied.')
```

### 2. **Role-Based Application Visibility**
- **Admins:** See applications for scholarships they created
- **OSAS Staff:** See ALL applications across all scholarships

### 3. **Fixed Assign Application Bug**
**Problem:** Using wrong field name `application.reviewer`  
**Solution:** Changed to `application.reviewed_by` (correct field name)

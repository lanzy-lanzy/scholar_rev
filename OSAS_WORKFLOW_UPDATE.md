# OSAS Workflow Update - Two-Tier Approval System

## What Changed?

The application review process now has **two stages**:

### Before (Old System)
```
OSAS Reviews → OSAS Approves/Rejects → Student Notified ✅
```

### Now (New System)
```
OSAS Reviews → OSAS Recommends → Admin Final Decision → Student Notified ✅
```

## Why This Change?

1. **Better oversight**: Admins have final say on scholarship awards
2. **Quality control**: Two-level review ensures thorough evaluation
3. **Accountability**: Clear separation of review vs. approval authority
4. **Audit trail**: Complete record of recommendations and decisions

## What This Means for OSAS Staff

### Your Role
You are now making **recommendations** rather than final decisions.

### Your Process (Mostly Unchanged)

1. **Review applications** in the review queue (same as before)
2. **Evaluate** student qualifications (same as before)
3. **Make recommendation**:
   - Click "Approve" → Recommends for approval
   - Click "Reject" → Recommends for rejection
   - Click "Request Info" → Ask student for more information (same as before)
4. **Add comments** explaining your recommendation (important!)
5. **Submit** your recommendation

### What Happens Next

After you submit your recommendation:

1. **Admin is notified** of your recommendation
2. **Admin reviews** your recommendation and comments
3. **Admin makes final decision** (approve or reject)
4. **You are notified** of the admin's decision
5. **Student is notified** of the final outcome

### New Status Labels

When you recommend an application, you'll see new status badges:

| Your Action | New Status | What It Means |
|-------------|------------|---------------|
| Click "Approve" | 🟢 OSAS Recommended for Approval | Waiting for admin to approve |
| Click "Reject" | 🟣 OSAS Recommended for Rejection | Waiting for admin to reject |

### Important: Your Comments Matter More Now!

Since admins will review your recommendations, **your comments are crucial**:

#### Good Comments Examples:
✅ "Strong academic record (3.8 GPA), excellent essay, all documents verified. Meets all eligibility criteria. Recommend approval."

✅ "GPA below minimum requirement (2.3 vs 3.0 required). Missing certificate of enrollment. Recommend rejection."

✅ "Good candidate but essay lacks depth. Recommend approval with reservation - admin should review essay carefully."

#### Poor Comments Examples:
❌ "Looks good" (too vague)
❌ "Approved" (doesn't explain why)
❌ "" (empty - no explanation)

### Notifications You'll Receive

You'll now get notifications when:
1. **Admin approves** your recommendation
   - "Application Approved by Admin"
2. **Admin rejects** your recommendation (even if you recommended approval)
   - "Application Rejected by Admin"

This helps you understand admin decision patterns and improve future recommendations.

### Dashboard Changes

Your OSAS dashboard now shows:
- Applications you've recommended (with new statuses)
- Notifications from admins about final decisions
- Your recommendation history

### Review Queue Changes

The review queue works the same, but:
- Applications you recommend move to "Pending Admin Decision"
- They no longer show as "Approved" or "Rejected" by you
- You can still see them in your review history

### Best Practices

1. **Be thorough in comments**: Explain your reasoning clearly
2. **Verify documents**: Check all required documents are present
3. **Check eligibility**: Ensure student meets all criteria
4. **Be objective**: Base recommendations on criteria, not personal feelings
5. **Be timely**: Admins are waiting for your recommendations

### Common Questions

**Q: Can I still approve/reject applications?**
A: You make recommendations. Admins make final decisions.

**Q: What if I disagree with an admin's decision?**
A: You'll be notified. You can discuss with the admin if needed. This helps improve the process.

**Q: Do I need to do anything differently?**
A: Your review process is the same. Just make sure to add detailed comments explaining your recommendation.

**Q: What happens to applications I already approved/rejected?**
A: Old applications keep their status. This only affects new applications going forward.

**Q: Can I see what admins decided?**
A: Yes, you'll receive notifications and can see the final status in the review queue.

**Q: What if admin takes too long to decide?**
A: Applications remain in "Pending Admin Decision" status. You can follow up with admins if needed.

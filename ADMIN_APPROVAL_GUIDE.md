- Use search to find specific students
- Filter by scholarship

#### Step 2: Click "Make Decision"

#### Step 3: Make Your Decision

Add optional comments explaining your decision.

#### Step 4: Submit

### Important Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Scholarship Slots**: The system checks if slots are available before allowing approval. If no slots remain, you'll see an error.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Cannot Undo**: Once you make a final decision, it's recorded permanently in the system. Review carefully!

‚úÖ **Audit Trail**: All your decisions are logged with timestamp and comments in the Decision History.

2. See all final decisions made by all admins

### Best Practices

1. **Review OSAS Comments**: They often contain important context
2. **Check Documents**: Verify all required documents are submitted
3. **Consider Slots**: Check how many slots remain for the scholarship
4. **Add Comments**: Explain your reasoning for future reference
5. **Be Timely**: Students are waiting for decisions
6. **Check History**: Review student's other applications if relevant

### Common Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: OSAS Recommends Approval, You Agree
‚úÖ Simply approve with optional comments like "Agreed with OSAS recommendation"

#### Scenario 2: OSAS Recommends Approval, You Disagree
‚ùå Reject with detailed comments explaining why you disagree

#### Scenario 3: OSAS Recommends Rejection, You Disagree
‚úÖ Approve with comments explaining your reasoning

#### Scenario 4: No Slots Available
‚ö†Ô∏è System will prevent approval automatically. Consider:
- Rejecting with explanation about slots
- Checking if you can increase scholarship slots
- Putting on waitlist (if implemented)

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Tab**: Navigate between form fields
- **Enter**: Submit form (when focused on submit button)
- **Esc**: Cancel (browser back)

### Troubleshooting

**Q: I don't see any pending approvals**
- Check if OSAS has reviewed any applications yet
- Verify you're logged in as an admin
- Check the filter tabs (might be filtered)

**Q: Can't approve an application**
- Check if scholarship slots are full
- Verify the application status is `osas_approved` or `osas_rejected`
- Check if you have admin permissions

**Q: Made a mistake in my decision**
- Contact system administrator
- Decisions are permanent and require database access to change
- This is by design for audit trail integrity

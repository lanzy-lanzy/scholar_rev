# 🔧 Fix: Empty Review Queue - No Applications Found

## 🎯 Problem
The Review Queue shows "No applications found" because there are no applications in the database yet.

## ✅ Solution: Create Test Data

I've created a management command to populate the database with test applications.

---

## 🚀 Quick Fix (Run This Command)

```powershell
python manage.py create_test_applications
```

This will create:
- ✅ **5 Student users** (student1-5)
- ✅ **1 Admin user** (admin)
- ✅ **3 Scholarships** (Academic Excellence, Financial Assistance, STEM Award)
- ✅ **Multiple Applications** (in pending status, ready for review)

### Issue: Still no applications after running command
**Solution:** 
1. Check command output for errors

3. Create Scholarships under "Core > Scholarships"
4. Login as student
5. Apply for scholarships

### Via Django Shell:
```python
python manage.py shell

from django.contrib.auth.models import User
from core.models import Application, Scholarship
from decimal import Decimal

# Get student and scholarship
student = User.objects.get(username='student1')
scholarship = Scholarship.objects.first()

# Create application
app = Application.objects.create(
    student=student,
    scholarship=scholarship,
    personal_statement='I deserve this scholarship...',
    gpa=Decimal('3.75'),
    status='pending'

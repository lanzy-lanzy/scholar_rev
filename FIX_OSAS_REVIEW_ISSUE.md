# Fix: OSAS Review Recommendations Not Saving

## Problem
OSAS staff could not submit recommendations (approve/reject). When clicking "Submit Review", the application status was not changing to `osas_approved` or `osas_rejected`.

## Root Cause
There were **two functions** with similar names in `core/views.py`:

1. **`application_review()`** (line 419) - Had the POST handling logic to save recommendations
2. **`review_application()`** (line 819) - Only rendered the template, no POST handling

The URL pattern in `core/urls.py` was pointing to the **wrong function**:
```python
path('review/<int:application_id>/', views.review_application, name='review_application'),
```

This meant when OSAS submitted the form, it went to `review_application()` which didn't process the POST data.

## Solution

### 1. Updated URL Routing (`core/urls.py`)
Changed the URL to point to the correct function:

**Before:**
```python
path('review/<int:application_id>/', views.review_application, name='review_application'),
```

**After:**
```python
path('review/<int:application_id>/', views.application_review, name='review_application'),
```

### 2. Updated Duplicate Function (`core/views.py`)
Modified the old `review_application()` function to redirect to the correct one:

**Before:**
```python
@login_required
def review_application(request, application_id):
    """OSAS/Admin view to review individual application."""
    # ... only rendered template, no POST handling
    return render(request, 'osas/application_review.html', context)
```

**After:**
```python
@login_required
def review_application(request, application_id):
    """OSAS/Admin view to review individual application - DEPRECATED.
    
    This function is deprecated. Use application_review() instead which handles POST requests.
    Keeping this for backwards compatibility but redirecting to the correct function.
    """
    return application_review(request, application_id)
```

## How It Works Now

### OSAS Review Flow:
1. OSAS staff navigates to `/review/<application_id>/`
2. URL routes to `application_review()` function
3. **GET request**: Displays the review form
4. **POST request**: Processes the form submission
   - Reads `action` field (approve/reject/request_info)
   - Calls `application.mark_as_reviewed()` with appropriate status
   - Creates notifications for admins
   - Redirects to review queue

### Status Changes:
- **Recommend for Approval** → Status: `osas_approved`
- **Recommend for Rejection** → Status: `osas_rejected`
- **Request Additional Info** → Status: `additional_info_required`

## Testing

### Manual Test:
1. Log in as OSAS user
2. Navigate to Review Queue
3. Click on any pending application
4. Select "Recommend for Approval"
5. Add comments
6. Click "Submit Review"
7. ✅ Status should change to "OSAS Recommended for Approval"
8. ✅ Admin should receive notification
9. ✅ Application should appear in Admin's "Pending Final Approvals"

### Automated Test:
Run the test script:
```bash
python test_osas_review_fix.py
```

## Verification

After the fix, verify:
- ✅ OSAS can submit recommendations
- ✅ Application status changes correctly
- ✅ Admins receive notifications
- ✅ Applications appear in "Pending Final Approvals"
- ✅ Success message displays after submission

## Files Modified
1. `core/urls.py` - Updated URL routing
2. `core/views.py` - Modified duplicate function to redirect

## Related Functions
- `application_review()` - Main function (handles GET and POST)
- `mark_as_reviewed()` - Model method that updates application status
- `admin_pending_approvals()` - Admin view to see OSAS recommendations

## Status Values
| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `pending` | New application |
| `under_review` | OSAS assigned to self |
| `osas_approved` | OSAS recommends approval ✅ |
| `osas_rejected` | OSAS recommends rejection ✅ |
| `approved` | Admin final approval |
| `rejected` | Admin final rejection |
| `additional_info_required` | More info needed |

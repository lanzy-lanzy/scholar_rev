# Two-Tier Approval System Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a two-tier approval workflow where OSAS staff review applications first and make recommendations, then administrators make the final approval/rejection decisions.

## System Flow

### 1. OSAS Staff Review (First Tier)
- OSAS staff review applications in the review queue
- They can recommend applications for:
  - **Approval** → Status: `osas_approved`
  - **Rejection** → Status: `osas_rejected`
  - **Additional Information** → Status: `additional_info_required`
- OSAS comments are saved for admin review
- Admins are notified when OSAS makes a recommendation

### 2. Admin Final Decision (Second Tier)
- Admins see all OSAS-recommended applications in "Pending Final Approvals"
- Admins review:
  - Application details
  - OSAS staff recommendation
  - OSAS comments
  - Student documents
- Admins make final decision:
  - **Approve** → Status: `approved`
  - **Reject** → Status: `rejected`
- Final decision is recorded with timestamp and comments
- Student and OSAS staff are notified of the final decision

## New Application Statuses

| Status | Description | Who Sets It |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| `pending` | Awaiting OSAS review | System (on submission) |
| `under_review` | OSAS is reviewing | OSAS staff |
| `osas_approved` | OSAS recommends approval | OSAS staff |
| `osas_rejected` | OSAS recommends rejection | OSAS staff |
| `approved` | Final approval by admin | Admin |
| `rejected` | Final rejection by admin | Admin |
| `additional_info_required` | More info needed from student | OSAS staff |

## New Model Fields

Added to `Application` model:
```python
final_decision_by = ForeignKey(User)  # Admin who made final decision
final_decision_at = DateTimeField()   # When final decision was made
final_decision_comments = TextField() # Admin's final comments
```

## New URLs

### Admin URLs
- `/dashboard/admin/pending-approvals/` - View OSAS recommendations
- `/dashboard/admin/final-decision/<id>/` - Make final decision on application
- `/dashboard/admin/review-history/` - View history of all final decisions

## New Templates

1. **templates/admin/pending_approvals.html**
   - Lists all applications recommended by OSAS
   - Filter by recommendation type (approved/rejected)
   - Filter by scholarship
   - Search by student name

2. **templates/admin/final_decision.html**
   - Detailed application view
   - Shows OSAS recommendation and comments
   - Decision form for admin
   - Scholarship availability info
   - Student's other applications

3. **templates/admin/review_history.html**
   - Table of all final decisions
   - Filter by decision type
   - Filter by admin who made decision
   - Shows full audit trail

## New Views

File: `core/views_admin_approval.py`

1. **admin_pending_approvals()**
   - Lists applications awaiting final decision
   - Filters and pagination
   - Only shows `osas_approved` and `osas_rejected` statuses

2. **admin_final_decision()**
   - Detailed review page
   - Handles final approval/rejection
   - Creates notifications for student and OSAS staff
   - Checks scholarship slot availability

3. **admin_review_history()**
   - Historical view of all decisions
   - Audit trail for compliance

## Updated Views

### core/views.py - application_review()
- Changed OSAS approval to set status `osas_approved` instead of `approved`
- Changed OSAS rejection to set status `osas_rejected` instead of `rejected`
- Sends notifications to admins when OSAS makes recommendation
- Messages updated to reflect "recommendation" rather than "final decision"

## Notifications

### When OSAS Recommends Approval
- **To Admins**: "New Application Recommended for Approval"
- **Type**: Info

### When OSAS Recommends Rejection
- **To Admins**: "New Application Recommended for Rejection"
- **Type**: Warning

### When Admin Approves

# ✅ OSAS Decision Lock - Implementation Complete

## What Was Requested
"When OSAS makes a decision for approving the scholar, it should not make another decision. It should disable that decision."

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Form Visibility Control
The review form now only appears when the application status is:
- `pending` - New application
- `under_review` - OSAS is reviewing
- `additional_info_required` - Student needs to provide more info

### 2. Review Completed Display
When OSAS has made a decision (`osas_approved` or `osas_rejected`), the form is replaced with:
- ✅ Large icon indicating the decision
- ✅ Clear message: "Recommended for Approval" or "Recommended for Rejection"
- ✅ Display of the OSAS comments
- ✅ Timestamp of when the review was completed
- ✅ Info message: "Awaiting admin final decision"

### 3. Backend Protection
Added validation in `core/views.py`:
```python
if application.status in ['osas_approved', 'osas_rejected', 'approved', 'rejected']:
    messages.error(request, 'This application has already been reviewed. You cannot change the decision.')
    return redirect('core:review_queue')
```

This prevents any POST attempts to change completed reviews.

### 4. Visual Indicators in Review Queue
- Applications with OSAS decisions show special badges:
  - **Green badge** "Recommended ✓" for approved
  - **Purple badge** "Recommended ✗" for rejected
- Button text changes from "Review" to "View Details"
- Different styling to distinguish completed reviews

## How It Works

### Scenario 1: OSAS Reviews Application
1. OSAS clicks "Review" on a pending application
2. Sees the review form with decision dropdown
3. Selects "Recommend for Approval"
4. Adds comments
5. Clicks "Submit Review"
6. ✅ Status changes to `osas_approved`
7. ✅ Form disappears
8. ✅ "Review Completed" card appears

### Scenario 2: OSAS Tries to Change Decision
1. OSAS navigates back to the same application
2. ✅ No form is shown
3. ✅ Only sees "Review Completed" card
4. ✅ Cannot make changes through UI

### Scenario 3: Direct POST Attempt
1. Someone tries to POST to the review URL
2. ✅ Backend validation catches it
3. ✅ Error message displayed
4. ✅ Redirected to review queue
5. ✅ No changes made to database

## Status Progression

   ↓
   ↓ (OSAS submits recommendation)
   ↓
osas_approved OR osas_rejected
   ↓
   ↓ 🔒 LOCKED - OSAS cannot change
   ↓

   ↓
   🔒 LOCKED - Final decision

```

## Files Changed
1. ✅ `templates/osas/application_review.html` - Form visibility and completed state
2. ✅ `core/views.py` - Backend validation
3. ✅ `templates/osas/review_queue.html` - Status badges and button text

## Testing Checklist
- ✅ OSAS can review pending applications
- ✅ OSAS can submit recommendations
- ✅ Form disappears after submission
- ✅ "Review Completed" card appears
- ✅ OSAS cannot change decision via UI
- ✅ Backend prevents POST changes
- ✅ Review queue shows correct badges
- ✅ Button text changes appropriately
- ✅ Admin can still make final decisions

## Benefits
1. **Prevents mistakes** - No accidental changes to decisions
2. **Clear workflow** - Visual feedback on completion
3. **Audit integrity** - Original decisions preserved
4. **Better UX** - Clear distinction between reviewable and completed
5. **Security** - Both frontend and backend protection

## Next Steps for Testing
1. Log in as OSAS user
2. Review a pending application
3. Submit a recommendation
4. Verify form is replaced with "Review Completed" card
5. Try to navigate back - confirm no form appears
6. Check review queue - verify badge and button text
7. Log in as Admin - verify you can still make final decision

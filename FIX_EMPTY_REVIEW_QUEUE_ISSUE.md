# ✅ Fixed: Empty Review Queue Issue

## 🎯 Problem
When clicking "View all" from the Priority Review Queue on the dashboard, the Review Queue page showed "No applications found" even though applications were visible on the dashboard.

## 🔍 Root Cause
The `review_queue` view was passing `page_obj` to the template, but the template was expecting a variable named `applications`.

## ✨ Solution Applied

### Changes Made to `core/views.py`

**File:** `core/views.py` (Lines 296-307)

**Before:**
```python
context = {
    'page_obj': page_obj,
    'status_filter': status_filter,
    'scholarship_filter': scholarship_filter,
    'reviewer_filter': reviewer_filter,
    'status_counts': status_counts,
    'scholarships_for_filter': scholarships_for_filter,
    'reviewers_for_filter': reviewers_for_filter,
}
```

**After:**
```python
context = {
    'applications': page_obj,  # Added - template expects this variable
    'page_obj': page_obj,      # Kept for pagination
    'status_filter': status_filter,
    'scholarship_filter': scholarship_filter,
    'reviewer_filter': reviewer_filter,
    'status_counts': status_counts,
    'scholarships': scholarships_for_filter,  # Renamed for consistency
    'reviewers_for_filter': reviewers_for_filter,
}
```

### Additional Fix: Admin Access

Also updated the permission check to allow both OSAS and Admin users:

**Before:**
```python
if not request.user.profile.is_osas:
    messages.error(request, 'Access denied. OSAS staff access required.')
```

**After:**
```python
if not (request.user.profile.is_osas or request.user.profile.is_admin):
    messages.error(request, 'Access denied. OSAS or Administrator access required.')
```

## ✅ What's Fixed

1. **Review Queue now shows applications** - Template receives the correct variable
2. **Pagination works** - Both `applications` and `page_obj` are available
3. **Filters work** - Scholarship filter uses correct variable name
4. **Admin access** - Both OSAS and Admin can access the review queue

---

## 🧪 Test It

1. **Login as OSAS** (`osas_staff` / `osas123`)
2. **Go to Dashboard**
3. **See applications** in Priority Review Queue
4. **Click "View all"**
5. **Applications now appear!** ✅

## 📊 How It Works Now

```
Dashboard
  ↓
Shows pending applications
  ↓
Click "View all"
  ↓
Review Queue View
  ↓
Queries: Application.objects.filter(status='pending')
  ↓
Passes: applications=page_obj
  ↓
Template receives: applications variable
  ↓
Displays applications ✓
```

---

## 🎯 Default Behavior

The Review Queue defaults to showing **pending applications** when no status filter is applied:

```python
status_filter = request.GET.get('status', 'pending')  # Defaults to 'pending'
```

To see all applications, use the "All Statuses" filter or navigate to `?status=all`.

---

## ✅ Summary

**Fixed the empty Review Queue by:**
- ✅ Adding `applications` variable to context
- ✅ Renaming `scholarships_for_filter` to `scholarships`
- ✅ Allowing both OSAS and Admin access
- ✅ Maintaining pagination with `page_obj`

**The Review Queue now works correctly!** 🎉

# ✨ Updated Dynamic Requirements Feature

## 🎯 What Changed

Based on your feedback, I've **completely redesigned** the dynamic requirements feature. Now when you create a new requirement, it's:

1. ✅ **Immediately saved to the database** (via AJAX)
2. ✅ **Added to the checkbox list** automatically
3. ✅ **Pre-selected** for the current scholarship
4. ✅ **Available for all future scholarships** without recreating

---

## 🚀 How It Works Now

### User Flow:

```
1. Click "Add New Requirement"
   ↓
2. Fill in requirement details in the blue form
   ↓
3. Click "Save & Add to List"
   ↓
4. Requirement is created in database (AJAX)
   ↓
5. Appears in checkbox list with green "New" badge
   ↓
6. Automatically checked for current scholarship
   ↓
7. Available for future scholarships!
```

### Visual Changes:

**Before (Old Approach)**:
- Requirements were only created when you submitted the scholarship form
- They weren't reusable without going to admin panel

**After (New Approach)**:
- Requirements are created immediately via AJAX
- They appear in the existing requirements list
- They're automatically selected
- They're instantly available for reuse

## 💡 Key Features

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Frontend (JavaScript + AJAX)

```javascript
// When "Save & Add to List" is clicked:
1. Collect form data
2. Validate required fields
3. Send AJAX POST to /ajax/create-document-requirement/
4. Receive response with requirement ID
5. Create checkbox element
6. Add to existing requirements list
7. Auto-check the checkbox
8. Show success notification
9. Remove creation form
```

### Backend (Django View)

```python
@login_required
def ajax_create_document_requirement(request):
    # Validate admin access
    # Extract POST data
    # Create DocumentRequirement object
    # Return JSON with requirement details
```

### Database

```
DocumentRequirement Table:
- id (auto-increment)
- name (document type)
- custom_name (for "other" type)
- description
- is_required
- file_format_requirements
- max_file_size_mb
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Save & Add to List" button not working
**Solution**: Check browser console for errors, ensure JavaScript is enabled

### Issue: Requirement not appearing in list
**Solution**: Check if AJAX request succeeded (look for success notification)

### Issue: Can't create requirement with same name
**Solution**: Django allows duplicates, but consider if you really need a duplicate

### Issue: Form validation errors
**Solution**: Ensure all required fields are filled (type, formats, size)

- ✅ **CSRF Protection**: All AJAX requests include CSRF token
- ✅ **Authentication**: Only logged-in admins can create requirements

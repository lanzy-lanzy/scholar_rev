# ✅ OSAS Functionality - All Fixes Applied

## 🎯 Issues Fixed

### 1. **Access to "All Applications" ✅**
**Problem:** OSAS staff got "Access denied" when clicking "All Applications"

**Solution:**
- Updated `view_applications` view in `core/views.py`
- Now allows both Admin AND OSAS access
- OSAS sees ALL applications (not just from their scholarships)
- Admins see only their scholarship applications

**Code Change:**
```python
# Line 611 in views.py
if not (request.user.profile.is_admin or request.user.profile.is_osas):
    messages.error(request, 'Access denied.')
```

### 2. **Sidebar Shows OSAS Menu ✅**
**Problem:** OSAS staff saw Student sidebar instead of OSAS sidebar

**Solution:**
- Updated `templates/base/base.html`
- Changed from Django groups to UserProfile properties
- Now correctly shows OSAS menu

**OSAS Sidebar Menu:**
- 📊 Dashboard
- 📋 Review Queue  
- 📄 All Applications
- 👤 Profile Settings
- 🚪 Sign Out

---

### 3. **Review Queue Operational ✅**
**Problem:** Review queue needed business logic implementation

**Solution:**
- Fixed `assign_application` function (changed `reviewer` to `reviewed_by`)
- Review queue fully functional with:
  - Status filters (Pending, Under Review, Approved, Rejected)
  - Scholarship filters
  - Reviewer filters (My Reviews, Unassigned, All)
  - Assign to Me functionality
  - Review and decision making

# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the scholarship detail page by adding a comprehensive requirements viewing section. Currently, the scholarship detail page shows basic eligibility criteria, but users need access to more detailed requirements information including academic requirements, documentation needed, and specific conditions. This feature will provide a clear, organized way for students to view all requirements for a scholarship before applying.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Display Comprehensive Requirements Section

**User Story:** As a student browsing scholarships, I want to view detailed requirements for a scholarship, so that I can determine if I meet all the criteria before starting my application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN the requirements section is displayed THEN the system SHALL organize requirements into logical categories (Academic Requirements, Documentation Requirements, Eligibility Requirements, Additional Requirements)
3. IF a scholarship has dynamic requirements THEN the system SHALL display those requirements in the appropriate category
4. WHEN requirements are displayed THEN the system SHALL format them in a clear, readable list format
5. IF a requirement has additional details or notes THEN the system SHALL display those details beneath the requirement

### Requirement 2: Requirements Data Model

5. WHEN requirements are saved THEN the system SHALL validate that at least one requirement exists for the scholarship

### Requirement 3: Requirements Display Integration

**User Story:** As a student viewing a scholarship, I want the requirements section to be easily accessible on the detail page, so that I don't have to search for this critical information.

### Requirement 4: Requirements Management in Admin

**User Story:** As an OSAS administrator, I want to easily manage scholarship requirements through the admin interface, so that I can keep requirement information up-to-date.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN editing requirements THEN the system SHALL allow adding, editing, and deleting individual requirement entries
3. WHEN reordering requirements THEN the system SHALL allow administrators to change the display order

# Scholarship Requirements Feature Added

## Summary
Added the ability to create **Scholarship Requirements** directly in the create/edit scholarship form, making it easier for admins to define eligibility criteria without needing to use Django Admin.

## What Was Added

### 1. Frontend (templates/admin/create_scholarship.html)

#### New Section: "Scholarship Requirements"
- Added before the "Document Requirements" section
- Allows admins to add multiple eligibility requirements dynamically
- Each requirement is a text input field
- Requirements can be removed individually
- Empty state message when no requirements are added

#### Features:
- **Add Requirement Button**: Dynamically adds new requirement input fields
- **Remove Button**: Each requirement has a delete button (trash icon)
- **Smooth Animations**: Fade-in/fade-out effects when adding/removing
- **Auto-focus**: New requirement fields are automatically focused
- **Empty State**: Shows helpful message when no requirements exist
- **Info Box**: Explains what scholarship requirements are for

### 2. Backend (core/views.py)

#### Updated `create_scholarship` View
- Extracts scholarship requirements from POST data
- Creates `ScholarshipRequirement` objects linked to the scholarship
- Requirements are saved with:
  - `category='eligibility'` (default)
  - `description` from user input
  - `order` based on sequence

#### Updated `edit_scholarship` View
- Deletes existing requirements first
- Creates new requirements from the form
- Maintains the same structure as create

## How It Works

### Creating a Scholarship with Requirements

1. Admin fills in basic scholarship info (title, amount, deadline, etc.)
2. In the "Scholarship Requirements" section, clicks "Add Requirement"
3. Enters requirement text (e.g., "Minimum GPA of 3.0")
4. Can add multiple requirements
5. Can remove any requirement before submitting
6. On form submit:
   - Scholarship is created
   - Each requirement is saved as a `ScholarshipRequirement` object
   - Requirements are linked to the scholarship via foreign key

### Data Flow

```
Form Input (scholarship_requirement_1, scholarship_requirement_2, ...)
    ↓
POST Request
    ↓
create_scholarship view extracts requirements
    ↓
Creates ScholarshipRequirement objects
    ↓
Linked to Scholarship via scholarship.requirements
```

### Database Structure

```python
ScholarshipRequirement:
  - scholarship (ForeignKey to Scholarship)
  - category (default: 'eligibility')
  - description (text from form)
  - order (sequence number)
  - notes (optional, not used in form)
```

## User Experience

### Before
- Admins had to create scholarship first
- Then go to Django Admin to add requirements
- Two-step process, not intuitive

### After
- Single form for everything
- Add requirements inline while creating scholarship
- Immediate visual feedback
- Can add/remove requirements before submitting
- More intuitive workflow

## Example Requirements

Students will see these on the scholarship detail page:
- "Minimum GPA of 3.0"
- "Must be enrolled in STEM program"
- "Must be a Filipino citizen"
- "Must demonstrate financial need"
- "Must maintain full-time enrollment status"

## Technical Details

### Form Field Naming
- Requirements use dynamic naming: `scholarship_requirement_1`, `scholarship_requirement_2`, etc.
- Counter increments with each new requirement
- Backend extracts all fields starting with `scholarship_requirement_`

### JavaScript Features
- Dynamic DOM manipulation
- Event delegation for remove buttons
- Smooth CSS animations
- Empty state management
- Input validation (non-empty check)

### Styling
- Consistent with existing form design
- Blue border for new requirements
- Hover effects on remove buttons
- Responsive layout
- Matches theme colors (primary-dark, accent-warm)

## Future Enhancements

Possible improvements:
1. **Category Selection**: Allow admins to choose requirement category (academic, eligibility, etc.)
2. **Drag & Drop Reordering**: Let admins reorder requirements
3. **Requirement Templates**: Pre-defined common requirements
4. **Rich Text Editor**: Format requirements with bold, lists, etc.
5. **Requirement Validation**: Check if student meets requirements automatically

## Testing

To test the feature:
1. Login as admin
2. Go to "Create Scholarship"
3. Fill in basic info
4. Click "Add Requirement" in Scholarship Requirements section
5. Enter requirement text
6. Add multiple requirements
7. Try removing a requirement
8. Submit form
9. Check scholarship detail page to see requirements displayed

## Files Modified

1. `templates/admin/create_scholarship.html` - Added UI section and JavaScript
2. `core/views.py` - Updated `create_scholarship` and `edit_scholarship` views

## Related Models

- `Scholarship` - Main scholarship model
- `ScholarshipRequirement` - Stores individual requirements
- Relationship: One-to-Many (Scholarship → ScholarshipRequirement)

## Notes

- Requirements are stored separately from `eligibility_criteria` field
- `eligibility_criteria` is still a text field for general description
- `ScholarshipRequirement` provides structured, categorized requirements
- Both can be used together for comprehensive eligibility information

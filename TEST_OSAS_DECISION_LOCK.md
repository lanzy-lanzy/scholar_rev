# Test: OSAS Decision Lock Feature

## Feature Description
Once OSAS staff makes a decision (recommend approval/rejection), they cannot change it. The review form is disabled and replaced with a "Review Completed" message.

## What Was Changed

### 1. Template (`templates/osas/application_review.html`)
**Before:** Form was shown for all statuses except `approved` and `rejected`

**After:** Form only shows for:
- `pending`
- `under_review`
- `additional_info_required`

For `osas_approved`, `osas_rejected`, `approved`, or `rejected` statuses, shows:
- ✅ "Review Completed" card
- Icon and message based on status
- Your review comments
- Timestamp of review
- Info message about awaiting admin decision (for OSAS recommendations)

### 2. Backend Validation (`core/views.py`)
Added check in `application_review()` function:
```python
if application.status in ['osas_approved', 'osas_rejected', 'approved', 'rejected']:
    messages.error(request, 'This application has already been reviewed. You cannot change the decision.')
    return redirect('core:review_queue')
```

This prevents POST requests from changing already-reviewed applications.

### 3. Review Queue (`templates/osas/review_queue.html`)
- Button text changes from "Review" to "View Details" for completed reviews
- Added status badges for `osas_approved` and `osas_rejected`
- Visual distinction between reviewable and completed applications

## Test Cases

### Test Case 1: OSAS Makes Initial Decision
**Steps:**
1. Log in as OSAS user
2. Go to Review Queue
3. Click on a pending application
4. Select "Recommend for Approval"
5. Add comments
6. Click "Submit Review"

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ Success message appears
- ✅ Status changes to "OSAS Recommended for Approval"
- ✅ Form is replaced with "Review Completed" card
- ✅ Shows green checkmark icon
- ✅ Displays your comments
- ✅ Shows "Awaiting admin final decision" message

### Test Case 2: OSAS Tries to Change Decision (UI)
**Steps:**
1. After making a decision (Test Case 1)
2. Stay on the same page or navigate back to the application

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ No form is shown
- ✅ Only "Review Completed" card is visible
- ✅ Cannot submit new decision through UI

### Test Case 3: OSAS Tries to Change Decision (Direct POST)
**Steps:**
1. After making a decision
2. Try to POST to the review URL directly (e.g., via browser dev tools or API)

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ Backend validation catches it
- ✅ Error message: "This application has already been reviewed. You cannot change the decision."
- ✅ Redirects to review queue
- ✅ Status remains unchanged

### Test Case 4: Review Queue Display
**Steps:**
1. Go to Review Queue
2. Look at applications with different statuses

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ Pending applications: Yellow badge "Pending", "Review" button
- ✅ Under review: Blue badge "Under Review", "Review" button
- ✅ OSAS approved: Green badge "Recommended ✓", "View Details" button
- ✅ OSAS rejected: Purple badge "Recommended ✗", "View Details" button

### Test Case 5: Admin Can Still Make Final Decision
**Steps:**
1. OSAS recommends approval
2. Log in as Admin
3. Go to Pending Final Approvals
4. Make final decision

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ Admin can see the application
- ✅ Admin can approve or reject
- ✅ OSAS recommendation is visible to admin
- ✅ Final decision overrides OSAS recommendation

## Status Flow

```
pending
  ↓ (OSAS assigns)
under_review
  ↓ (OSAS recommends)
osas_approved OR osas_rejected  ← LOCKED! Cannot change
  ↓ (Admin decides)
approved OR rejected  ← LOCKED! Cannot change
```

## Visual Indicators

### Review Completed Card Shows:
- **osas_approved**: Green checkmark, "Recommended for Approval"
- **osas_rejected**: Purple X, "Recommended for Rejection"
- **approved**: Green checkmark, "Approved by Admin"
- **rejected**: Red X, "Rejected by Admin"

### Review Queue Badges:
- **pending**: Yellow with pulse animation
- **under_review**: Blue with pulse animation
- **osas_approved**: Green "Recommended ✓"
- **osas_rejected**: Purple "Recommended ✗"

## Files Modified
1. `templates/osas/application_review.html` - Form visibility logic
2. `core/views.py` - Backend validation
3. `templates/osas/review_queue.html` - Status badges and button text

## Security
- ✅ Frontend: Form hidden for completed reviews
- ✅ Backend: POST validation prevents changes
- ✅ Database: Status values are controlled
- ✅ Audit trail: reviewed_at and reviewed_by are preserved

## Benefits
1. **Prevents accidental changes** - OSAS can't accidentally modify their decision
2. **Clear workflow** - Visual feedback shows decision is final
3. **Audit trail** - Original decision and timestamp are preserved
4. **Admin authority** - Only admins can make final binding decisions
5. **Better UX** - Clear indication of completed vs pending reviews

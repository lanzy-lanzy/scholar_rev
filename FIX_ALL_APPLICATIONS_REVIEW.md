# ✅ Fixed: Review Button in "All Applications"

## 🎯 Problem
In the "All Applications" page, clicking the "Review" button gave "Access denied" error for OSAS staff because it was using the admin-only review URL.

## ✅ Solution Applied

### Changed URL in Template
**File:** `templates/admin/view_applications.html` (Line 123)

**Before:**
```django
<a href="{% url 'core:admin_review_application' application.id %}" class="btn-sm btn-secondary">
    Review
</a>
```

**After:**
```django
<a href="{% url 'core:review_application' application.id %}" class="btn-sm btn-secondary">
    Review
</a>
```

## 🔄 What Changed

### Before:
- **Review Queue** → `review_application` → ✅ Works for both Admin & OSAS
- **All Applications** → `admin_review_application` → ❌ Only works for Admin

### After:
- **Review Queue** → `review_application` → ✅ Works for both Admin & OSAS
- **All Applications** → `review_application` → ✅ Works for both Admin & OSAS

---

## ✅ Now Both Pages Work!

### Review Queue (`/review-queue/`)
- ✅ OSAS can click "Review" → Works
- ✅ Admin can click "Review" → Works

### All Applications (`/view-applications/`)
- ✅ OSAS can click "Review" → **Now works!**
- ✅ Admin can click "Review" → Works

## 🧪 Test It

### As OSAS Staff:
1. Login: `osas_staff` / `osas123`
2. Go to **"All Applications"** in sidebar
3. Click **"Review"** button on any application
4. **Should work now!** ✅

### As Admin:
1. Login: `admin` / `admin123`
2. Go to **"All Applications"**

## 📊 URL Routing Summary

### Shared Review URLs (Both Admin & OSAS):
- `/review/<id>/` → `review_application` view
- `/assign/<id>/` → `assign_application` view
- `/submit-review/<id>/` → `submit_review` view

### Admin-Only URLs (Deprecated for review):
- `/dashboard/admin/applications/<id>/review/` → `admin_review_application` (not used anymore)

## 🎯 Consistent Experience

# Dynamic Requirements Implementation - Summary

## ‚úÖ Task Completed

I've successfully implemented a **dynamic document requirements feature** for the scholarship creation form. Administrators can now add custom document requirements on-the-fly while creating scholarships, without needing to pre-configure them in the admin panel.

---

## üìã Changes Made

### 1. **Frontend (Template)**
**File**: `templates/admin/create_scholarship.html`

#### Added Features:
- ‚ú® **"Add New Requirement" button** - Prominently placed in the Document Requirements section
- üé¥ **Dynamic requirement cards** - Each card includes:
  - Document type dropdown (13 predefined types + "Other")
  - Custom name field (conditional, appears for "Other" type)
  - Description/instructions textarea
  - File format requirements input
  - Max file size input (1-50 MB)
  - "Is Required" checkbox
- ‚ùå **Remove button** on each card with smooth fade-out animation
- üé¨ **Smooth animations** - Slide-in for new cards, fade-out for removed cards
- üìú **Auto-scroll** - Automatically scrolls to newly added requirements
- üîÑ **Conditional logic** - Custom name field only shows when "Other" is selected

#### CSS Additions:
```css
.animate-fade-out {
    animation: fadeOut 0.3s ease-out forwards;
}

@keyframes fadeOut {
    from { opacity: 1; transform: translateY(0); }
    to { opacity: 0; transform: translateY(-10px); }
}
```

#### JavaScript Logic:
- Manages requirement counter for unique field names
- Handles add/remove operations
- Validates conditional fields
- Provides smooth UX with animations

---

### 2. **Backend (View)**
**File**: `core/views.py`

#### Updated `create_scholarship` Function:
```python
# Added logic to process dynamic requirements
# Iterates through numbered POST fields (new_doc_type_1, new_doc_type_2, etc.)
# Creates DocumentRequirement objects
# Associates them with the scholarship
```

#### Key Features:
- ‚úÖ Processes unlimited dynamic requirements
- ‚úÖ Creates `DocumentRequirement` objects in database
- ‚úÖ Handles custom names for "Other" type
- ‚úÖ Validates and sanitizes input data
- ‚úÖ Associates requirements with scholarship via many-to-many relationship
- ‚úÖ Maintains backward compatibility with existing requirements

#### Import Added:
```python
from .models import DocumentRequirement
```

---

### 3. **Tests**
**File**: `core/tests.py`

#### New Test Class: `DynamicRequirementsTest`
Three comprehensive test cases:

1. **`test_create_scholarship_with_dynamic_requirements`**
   - Tests creating scholarship with multiple dynamic requirements
   - Verifies database objects are created correctly
   - Checks associations are properly established

2. **`test_create_scholarship_without_dynamic_requirements`**
   - Ensures existing functionality still works
   - Tests backward compatibility

3. **`test_dynamic_requirement_with_custom_name`**
   - Tests "Other" document type with custom name
   - Verifies custom name display logic

---

### 4. **Documentation**
Created three comprehensive documentation files:

1. **`DYNAMIC_REQUIREMENTS_FEATURE.md`**
   - Technical overview
   - Implementation details
   - Field naming conventions
   - Benefits and future enhancements

2. **`FEATURE_USAGE_GUIDE.md`**
   - Step-by-step usage instructions
   - Visual walkthrough
   - Example scenarios (Art, Athletic, Research scholarships)
   - Tips and best practices
   - Troubleshooting guide

3. **`IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`** (this file)
   - Complete summary of changes
   - Testing instructions
   - Verification checklist
